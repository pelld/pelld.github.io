To post with GitHub I am assuming you have followed the steps detailed by `Andy South` here: http://andysouth.github.io/blog-setup/. Then to get cracking create a new file in the `_posts` folder and copy this 

```

layout: post
title: Part where I write the title

```

ensuring to add the three dashes and colon and post. Remember also to name your post with a date (pretty sure about this step but not 100%) and add the file extension `.md`
