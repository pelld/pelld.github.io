That is regardless of how many grams of these foods you eat per day they only count as a limited amount towards your five-a-day value.\r\n\r\nThis can be coded in `r` using the `pmin()` function this takes two arguments, firstly the value to be capped eg. `NDNS$beansg` and the amount to cap at eg `150g` which gives:\r\n\r\n```{r, eval=FALSE}\r\npmin(NDNS$beansg, 150)\r\n```\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
